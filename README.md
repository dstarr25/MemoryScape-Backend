# CRUD API

*an api server that returns post information which is stored in mongodb*

[deployed url](https://devon-api-6xwz.onrender.com)

## Extra credit
* Added a search feature - I didn't use the code on the assignment because it didn't grab what it was supposed to
* Made the tags into an array, this is now how they are stored in the backend and in redux, and whenever they are edited it displays a string with all of them joined with ", "
* My edit note form now has required fields so you can't leave any of them empty while editing
